            Create servers and resources with ease.
            Export and build all the files you will need to run a server when you are done.

            Whenever you ready to test your creation, hit this button.

            It will start the dev server and open <strong>Game</strong> view tab in editor,
            it may take some time to load though, be patient!
          </p>

          <p>
            Once server has started - hit it again to stop the dev server.

            This is the main area where you can editor your project files, <strong>Game</strong> view tab also lives here.

          <p>
            Are you familiar with Microsoft's VSCode? If so, you know FXCode already, other than that, we have:

              <li>Game view</li>
              <li>Resource monitor</li>

          <p>
            When your creation is shaped nicely, it's time to build it!
          </p>

          <p>
            FxDK will build your resources and configuration files and place ready-to-run server under selected build path.
          </p>

          <p>
            All you have to do next is add your license key in there and deploy it on your server.
          </p>

        <h3>Farewell Theia, long live FXCode!</h3>
        <h5>FXCode - is our fork of Code - OSS, which is better known as  Microsoft's VS Code</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>
            With this update we can finally offer the best extensions compatibility, since it's an actual thing and not look-alike like Theia was
          </li>

          <li>
            Our additions like Resource Monitor and Client/Server Console have been reworked to fit their new home
          </li>

          <li>
            We plan to keep FXCode updated to the latest stable VS Code release, but expect delays for about 2-3 weeks, but most likely will happen faster
          </li>

            ‚ö†Ô∏è If you were using <kbd>.fxdkignore</kbd> files in your project they were treated wrong as it was <kbd>.fxdkinclude</kbd>, this has been fixed.
            <br/>
            These files actually must contain list of rules for files to actually ignore during build.

            ‚ö†Ô∏è In-project <kbd>system-resources</kbd> has been <strong>deprecated</strong>, we'll do our best to upgrade your project when it opens.
            <br/>
            Though, if you did modify that folder we will not remove it, but only rename, <em>shame on you</em>!
          </li>
          <li>
            System resources needed for project can now be tweaked in <strong>Project Settings</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            You can now import some example resources from cfx-server-data
